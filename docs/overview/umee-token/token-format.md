# Token Format

![Native UX tokens are used across the Cosmos ecosystem, while ERC-20 UX tokens are used across the Ethereum ecosystem.](/bg/token-format.png)

Different [blockchains](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain) typically use different versions of tokens. Most tokens can be used across blockchains if converted to the correct format. It’s important to know which type of tokens you are in possession of before interacting with any [web3](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-web3) applications.


> The UX token exists in two forms: a Cosmos native version (the native UX token) and an ERC-20 token version native to Ethereum. The two forms of UX tokens can be freely [converted to one another](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens).

### Native UX Tokens

****

> Most Cosmos tokens like the native UX token are interoperable with other Cosmos blockchains by design. [Cosmos ecosystem](/learn-the-basics/cosmos-basics) users can easily transfer tokens between chains in a fast and trustless manner.

_**The main purpose of the native UX token** is to participate in the PoS consensus mechanism to help secure the UX blockchain and earn PoS staking yield, pay gas fees on the UX blockchain to execute UX’s cross chain DeFi transactions, and to be able to vote and participate in protocol governance decisions._

**You are in possession of the **_**native UX token**_** native to the UX chain if any of the following are true:**

- Your tokens are stored in an UX chain compatible wallet like Keplr.
- You purchased UX on a Cosmos-based decentralized exchange.
- You bridged UX from Ethereum to the UX chain.

### ERC-20 UX Tokens

****

> ERC-20 tokens are not compatible with Cosmos blockchains unless converted to a Cosmos native format. Similarly, native Cosmos tokens are not compatible with Ethereum blockchains unless converted to an ERC-20 format.

_**The main purpose of the ERC-20 UX token** is to create a user-friendly experience for UX to tap into the DeFi legos on Ethereum and allow  people to seamlessly access the UX token as an ERC-20 token and hold or trade it on centralized exchanges._

**You are in possession of the **_**ERC-20 UX token**_** native to the Ethereum blockchain if any of the following are true:**

- Your tokens are stored in an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.
- You purchased UX on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.
- You bridged UX from the UX chain to Ethereum.
