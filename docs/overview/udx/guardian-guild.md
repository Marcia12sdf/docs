## What is the Guardian Guild?

The Guardian Guild is a working group which is responsible for analyzing borrower creditworthiness before loans are issued by UDX. Guardians will be compensated based on the spread of the loans issued to borrowers in addition to UX token incentives.

## Guardian Rankings

Guardians will be ranked based on the quality of their loans as well as their ability to execute on various lending agreements. Since UDX plans on issuing blockchain-specific loans it will be easy to monitor the health of loans issued at any time and determine when actions (like the liquidation of a borrowerâ€™s collateral) should be taken. 

The UDX DAO will structure performance bonuses which properly incentivize Guardians to issue high quality loans to reputable borrowers.
