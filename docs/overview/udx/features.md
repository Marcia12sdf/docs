## Fixed Term Loans

While existing DeFi loans are mainly used by speculators over short periods, UDX will enable term loans to a wide range of reputable borrowers. Loans will range from 1-5 years, making them more attractive for builders in search of steady capital and investors looking to diversify their risk/return profiles.

The loans offered by UDX will be customizable in order to provide optimal terms for lenders and borrowers. Interest payments can be made in the form of the principal asset or the protocol token, meaning a borrower can post protocol tokens as collateral to borrow stablecoins and interest payments can be made in the form of the [proof of stake rewards](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-staking.html#staking-rewards) from the [blockchain](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain) being secured.

## Credit Analysis

UDX will contract experts from a [Guardian Guild](/overview/udx/guardian-guild) to analyze borrower creditworthiness. Guardians will be ranked on the quality of their loans and their ability to execute on lending agreements, meaning Guardians will lean on the side of caution.

::: tab Public Pools

### Public Pools

****

Anyone can deposit stablecoins into a public pool to earn lending interest and a portion of UX’s [staking rewards](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-staking.html#staking-rewards). Public pools allow DeFi users to receive fixed rates for lending their assets over certain time periods rather than being subject to the constantly fluctuating rates based on current supply and demand seen in decentralized money market protocols.

::: tab Private Pools

### Private Pools

****

Depositors must go through a whitelisting process authorized by the [Guardian Guild](/overview/udx/guardian-guild) in order to lend through a private pool. Different private pools can offer more favorable terms for lenders with different intended durations and risk preferences.

### PoS Validators

****

UDX will work to lend to key validator service providers in order to accelerate the adoption of [PoS](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/types-of-blockchains) as the dominant consensus mechanism for the entire [web3](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-web3) industry. UDX plans to support a wide range of Proof of Stake blockchains including but not limited to [Cosmos](/learn-the-basics/cosmos-basics), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), [Near](https://near.org/), [Solana](https://solana.com/), and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

::: tab Custody Providers

### Custody Providers

****

Since custody providers are required to disclose their assets under custody and are expected to maintain high levels of security when it comes to the cold storage of crypto assets, they are well suited for exchanging credit. UDX enables trusted custody providers to act as borrowers or lenders while managing risk appropriately.

::: tab Funds & Builders

### Funds & Builders

****

Loans underwritten by UDX can be used as a steady source of yield for funds and builders, not limited to only crypto players. Institutions may find it more appealing to consider using UDX as loan repayment history, borrowers’ profiles, and use of funds are all public information on the loan specific blockchains, which create an unprecedented level of transparency in the loan business. Given the loans are fixed terms and duration can be customized, funds and builders can also plan around their growth and investment strategy utilizing UDX services.

::: tab Ecosystems

### Ecosystems

****

Battle-tested DeFi protocols and ecosystems can take advantage of UDX’s collateralized loans for strategic expansion and acquisitions or ecosystem consolidation/expansion. UDX can also be a secure source of yield as part of projects’ treasury management solution.
