# Collateral and Leverage Assets

---

<details><summary>What's the difference between Collateral Asset(CA) and Leverage Asset(LA)?</summary>

_Collateral assets are the cryptocurrencies that are used to secure your loans on UX (e.g. USDC, ATOM, USDT, stATOM, and those marked as “Collateral” on the UX app)._

_When you borrow funds, you have to deposit collateral assets first to ensure that the loan can be fully backed. If the value of your collateral assets decreases below a certain threshold, your position will be at risk of being liquidated._

_Leverage assets are the cryptocurrencies that you can only supply and borrow on UX. Leverage assets cannot be used as collateral._

_The UX community uses [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/ux/discussions) to propose new assets to list. Listing an asset as a Collateral Asset or Leverage Asset is determined by the risk profile of the token._
