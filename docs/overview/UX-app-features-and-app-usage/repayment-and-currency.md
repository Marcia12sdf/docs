<details><summary>How and when do I pay back my loans on UX?</summary>

_You can repay your loans by accessing the UX web app and selecting the loan you wish to repay. There's no set due date for repaying your loans, as long as you maintain a healthy LTV ratio._

_This methodology ensures a more stable and secure borrowing environment amid price fluctuations._
