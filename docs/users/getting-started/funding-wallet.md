#### 1) Select the "Withdraw" option for the ATOM token on your centralized exchange of choice.

> You can also choose to withdraw other Cosmos assets supported by your exchange, like the [UX token](/overview/umee-token).

#### 2) Copy your Cosmos wallet address found under the "Cosmos Hub" network in your [UX chain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet), and paste it in the "Send to" section.

> If you're withdrawing a different Cosmos asset like the [UX token](/overview/umee-token) you will need to [choose the appropriate network before copying your wallet address](/users/getting-started/using-wallet.html#copying-a-wallet-address).

#### 3) Select withdraw, approve the withdrawal, and wait for the transaction to process. Your ATOM will appear on the _Cosmos Hub network_ in your UX chain compatible wallet shortly.

#### Once you have received the ATOM on the Cosmos Hub network in your UX chain compatible wallet you can:

- [Transfer it to a decentralized exchange to trade it for other assets like UX](/users/getting-started/funding-wallet.html#trading-cosmos-assets-on-a-decentralized-exchange)
- [Transfer it to the UX chain](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens) to [supply on the UX market](/users/using-the-web-app/supply-withdraw) and start earning supply yield
