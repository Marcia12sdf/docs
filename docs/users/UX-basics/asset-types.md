### What Are Collateral Assets?

Collateral assets are assets that lenders can supply as a security guarantee in order to take out a loan. Users who supply collateral assets can borrow a smaller value of another asset against it.

### What Are the Risks Associated With Collateral Assets?

When borrowing from UX's money markets users' positions must remain properly over-collateralized or their collateral will be liquidated. When a [liquidation](/users/UX-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation) occurs a portion of the assets a user has supplied as collateral are used to pay off the outstanding loan plus the [liquidation penalty](/users/UX-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation-penalty).

<br>

### How Are Collateral Assets Determined?

Not all assets listed on UX are collateral assets. UX's Risk Team evaluates the risk profile of each asset based on the [UX Risk Framework](/governance/asset-listing/risk-assessment-methodology). Only assets that meet the safety criteria can be supported as collateral assets.

<br>

### TLDR

#### When collateral assets are supplied on the UX Market:

- The supplier is able to borrow against the collateral assets supplied;
- The supplier is able to earn lending interest on the collateral assets supplied;
- The assets supplied as collateral may be [liquidated](/users/UX-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation) in order to ensure that the borrower's debts are covered.

> Identify leverage assets by selecting the blue "Leverage" bubble on the [Markets page](https://app.ux.xyz/#/markets).

### What Are Leverage Assets?

Leverage assets are assets that can be lent and borrowed on UX's money markets but cannot be used as collateral for borrowing. Since leverage assets cannot be borrowed against they're not at risk of [liquidation](/users/UX-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation) in the event a borrower fails to remain properly over-collateralized.

<br>

### TLDR

#### When leverage assets are supplied on the UX Market:

- The supplier is unable to borrow against the leverage assets supplied;
- The supplier is able to earn lending interest on the leverage assets supplied;
- The leverage assets are not at risk of [liquidation](/users/UX-basics/common-terms.html#liquidation).
