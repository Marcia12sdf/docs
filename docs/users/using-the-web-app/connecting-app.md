> Once you have created an [UX chain compatible wallet](/users/getting-started/creating-wallet.html#creating-an-umee-blockchain-compatible-wallet), you will be able to connect it to UX's web app and easily [transfer tokens onto UX](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens).

#### 1) Go to [app.umee.cc](https://app.umee.cc/) (mainnet) or [testnet.umee.cc](https://testnet.umee.cc/) (testnet).

#### 2) You should now see a pop-up from your UX chain compatible wallet. Approve the connection request to connect to your account on the UX chain. _Testnet users will also be asked to approve a chain add request._

> This will allow the UX web app to know your wallet address and balances, and give the app the ability to request approval for transactions initiated by the user. This does NOT give the UX web app the ability to spend tokens without permission.

#### If you do not see the pop-up, select the "Connect" button in the top right corner and approve the connection and chain add requests as necessary.

#### You have now connected your UX wallet to the UX web app. As you begin [transferring assets across chains](/users/using-the-web-app/transferring-tokens) you will be asked to approve connections for each individual chain.
