# Community Support

> TLDR: Community Support leaders help organize, moderate, and support community members across all active UX community channels.

> To get started as a community support leader:
>
> - Visit the #start-here channel in the "Community DAO" section of [UX's Discord](https://discord.gg/uxchain);
> - Assign yourself the "CD Contributor" role and "CD Support" role;
> - Check the #cd-announcements and #support-rfc channels to get an idea of the type of contributions the committee will be looking for;
> - [Use this form to submit community support related contributions at the end of a period](https://dyno.gg/form/1e31964c).

## Overview

Identify underserved platforms and create and lead regional UX Community channels. Coordinate with other contributors to avoid unnecessary work - there is no need to volunteer as a moderator on channels that are already well-covered or channels that don't have an active community.

When submitting your work, providing a link to the community channel is enough - please don't link individual messages.

### Tips

---

- Turn on post notifications for UX's official channels so updates can be shared with your community in a timely manner;

## Creating New Channels

### Requirements

---

- Communicate with your local community to ensure there is clear demand for the channel before creating it - only channels that are actively used can be considered valuable;
- Disclose that it is a community-run channel and include links to official channels;
- Appoint at least one other trusted community member as an admin so the account does not rely entirely on a single contributor;
- Use a unique password and require 2fa for any admins;
- Be respectful and avoid spamming existing channels in an effort to grow the channel;
- Follow UX's [branding guidelines](https://ux.xyz/brand/).

## Contribution Ideas

> The following ideas are examples of contributions that may be considered valuable. Actual token allocations will be assigned at the sole discretion of the [Community DAO Committee](/governance/community-dao/overview.html#the-committee).

- Create and moderate regional community channels (e.g. an "UX Spanish Community" Telegram channel) on regionally significant platforms as needed
- Translate important announcements and lead regional communities on [UX's official Discord](https://discord.gg/uxchain)
- Help troubleshoot common issues on Discord and/or other community channels
- Create and distribute useful resources like infographics and tutorial gifs to help with troubleshooting
- Lead productive conversations across community channels like Discord, Telegram, Reddit, and Commonwealth

<br>

## Criteria

- Amount of value the contribution has brought or is expected to bring to UX;
- Clarity of contributions on the submission form;
- Professionalism;
- Total amount of activity within managed channels;
- Accuracy.
