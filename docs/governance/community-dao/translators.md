# Translators

> TLDR: Translators are responsible for translating, organizing, and sharing official UX content with the community members who need it. Translators must [apply for a translation](https://app.dework.xyz/umee-community-dao/translations-42914/overview) and be approved before completing it.

> To get started as an translator:
>
> - Visit the #start-here channel in the "Community DAO" section of [UX's Discord](https://discord.gg/uxchain);
> - Assign yourself the "CD Contributor" role and "CD Translator" role;
> - Check the #cd-announcements and #translations-rfc channels to see which translations the CD Committee is looking for;
> - [Apply for the translation through Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/umee-community-dao/translations-42914/overview);
> - [Use this form to submit each native translation completed](https://dyno.gg/form/a16fa490).

**[Medium](https://medium.com/)**

_Medium is likely the easiest platform to publish and organize professional looking translations of blog posts on. Medium publications can be used to allow multiple writers to contribute to the same blog to help stay organized. If a Medium publication is created, be sure to disclose that it is a community account used solely to translate official blog posts, and follow UX's [branding guidelines](https://umee.cc/brand/)._

<br>

**[Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)**

_Notion is another organizational tool that can be used to share translated blog posts on. Try to choose a platform that other translators and readers will both prefer._
