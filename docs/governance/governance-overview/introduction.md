# What is UX Governance?

![](/bg/governance.png)

In crypto, blockchains and applications are commonly governed by their users. By distributing [governance tokens](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/types-of-crypto.html#utility-tokens) to users, contributors, and investors, a project is able to better align the decision making process with the interests of all stakeholders.

UX uses an on-chain governance structure where governance proposals are [voted on](/users/governance/voting) by community members who [stake UX](/users/staking-UX/staking-UX). Each staked [UX token](/overview/UX-token/) represents a single vote, so users who stake more UX tokens obtain greater influence over UX's future. When community members who stake their UX fail to vote before a deadline, their votes are inherited by the [validator](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator) they have delegated their stake to.

Since UX governance takes place on-chain, the results of votes are always visible by everyone. Additionally, votes on certain proposals other than text proposals can trigger on-chain events that cannot be stopped by a single person or group of people including the UX core team.

> UX aims to make the governance process as easy and accessible as possible. If you have any suggestions, please share them with the community in the #suggestions channel on the [UX Discord server](https://discord.gg/uxchain).
