# Delegation Applications

## Sharing Contributions

Validators interested in applying for an UX Foundation delegation should self-assign the "Validator" role on the [UX Discord](https://discord.gg/uxchain). It is recommended to constantly check for updates in the relevant channels. #vali-contributions channel on Discord is created to share contributions and validator resources as they are created for UX. This helps bring maximum visibility to the overall validator community and the thread function is enabled for discussion and follow-up questions. Be prepared to discuss your contributions with the validator community.

> Providing detailed descriptions and links to specific contributions is extremely important.

> Validators should submit an application every quarter in order to be eligible for a foundation delegation.
