# Validator DAO Overview

## Introduction

The Umee Validator DAO is proposed with the intention of further decentralizing decision making on all matters around the Umee [validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator). The operations of the Umee Validator DAO will be fully led and run by the [Validator DAO Committee](/governance/validator-dao/the-committee) made up of volunteers from the Umee validator community.

At its initial stage, the first and foremost responsibility of the DAO is Umee Foundation delegation decisions. Going forward, the Umee Core team will be taking a support role in optimizing and expanding the functions and impact of the Umee Validator DAO with the goal of building a successful, inclusive and sustainable validator community for Umee in the long run.

## How it Works

::: tab Validators

### Validators

---

Validators in the Umee ecosystem are encouraged to make contributions in exchange for a delegation from the Umee Foundation. Any validators who are interested in receiving an Umee Foundation delegation can submit a validator delegation application detailing the contributions they make. The Umee Foundation gives validator delegation on a quarterly basis. Such delegation decisions are made by the Umee Validator DAO Committee.

> If you are a validator and wish to receive a delegation, [you can find the application details here](/governance/validator-dao/delegation-applications).

### Validator DAO Committee

---

The Umee Validator DAO is governed by the Umee Validator DAO Committee, responsible for making delegation decisions on a quarterly basis.

In addition to the quarterly delegation decisions, the committee may also present and assign ad hoc task requests for validators. Selected validators will be granted additional delegation by the committee.

The committee is composed of 5 members, selected through a community voting process on the CommonWealth thread. Provided there are no issues, the same committee may serve multiple quarters.
