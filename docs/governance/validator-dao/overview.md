# Validator DAO Overview

## Introduction

The UX Validator DAO is proposed with the intention of further decentralizing decision making on all matters around the UX [validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator). The operations of the UX Validator DAO will be fully led and run by the [Validator DAO Committee](/governance/validator-dao/the-committee) made up of volunteers from the UX validator community.

At its initial stage, the first and foremost responsibility of the DAO is UX Foundation delegation decisions. Going forward, the UX Core team will be taking a support role in optimizing and expanding the functions and impact of the UX Validator DAO with the goal of building a successful, inclusive and sustainable validator community for UX in the long run.

## How it Works

::: tab Validators

### Validators

---

Validators in the UX ecosystem are encouraged to make contributions in exchange for a delegation from the UX Foundation. Any validators who are interested in receiving an UX Foundation delegation can submit a validator delegation application detailing the contributions they make. The UX Foundation gives validator delegation on a quarterly basis. Such delegation decisions are made by the UX Validator DAO Committee.

> If you are a validator and wish to receive a delegation, [you can find the application details here](/governance/validator-dao/delegation-applications).

### Validator DAO Committee

---

The UX Validator DAO is governed by the UX Validator DAO Committee, responsible for making delegation decisions on a quarterly basis.

In addition to the quarterly delegation decisions, the committee may also present and assign ad hoc task requests for validators. Selected validators will be granted additional delegation by the committee.

The committee is composed of 5 members, selected through a community voting process on the CommonWealth thread. Provided there are no issues, the same committee may serve multiple quarters.
