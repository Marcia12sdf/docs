# Security & Audits

There are certain industry standards in place to help protect users, including the extensive auditing of code to find any potential weaknesses before a product is launched and any real money is at stake. Security is a priority for UX, which is why UX has contracted several top auditors to inspect every line of code and flag any potential vulnerabilities before going live.
