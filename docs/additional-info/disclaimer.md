**While UX takes strong security precautions, DeFi is still highly experimental.** **By interacting with the UX network and/or web app you acknowledge that you understand and accept all potential risks.**

Security is a priority for UX, but there is no guarantee that all risks can be eliminated. UX users must familiarize themselves with the risks (asset risk, contract risk, human error, hacks, liquidation, etc.) involved in DeFi before interacting with UX products.&#x20;

All DeFi products expose users to the risk of loss. When using UX products, never invest or deposit more than you can afford to lose.

Please DYOR (do your own research) before interacting with UX products. All content provided on UX community channels is for informational purposes only, and should not be construed as financial advice.
