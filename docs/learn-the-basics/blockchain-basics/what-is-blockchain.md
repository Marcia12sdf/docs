## What is a Blockchain?

In simple terms, a blockchain can be thought of as a distributed system used to keep virtual records. While digital record-keeping has been widely used for decades, blockchain technology is unique because it allows records to be kept in a way that is decentralized, trustless, accessible, and transparent. Blockchain systems are the backbone of [crypto](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-crypto) and [web3](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-web3).

Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies because its decentralized and trustless nature ensures that the truth of a state (facts, data, financial balances) is kept and maintained without relying on any centralized third party (centralized databases, financial institutions, or any authorities) and can be openly accessed by anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world.

## Why Decentralization Matters

All of the digital tools we rely on today are provided by centralized organizations that have the power to revoke access at any time for any reason; therefore we, as users, must play by their rules. For example, if you use your debit card to transact somewhere your bank doesn't approve of, your bank has the power to freeze your funds. If you wish to send money internationally, you must wait to do so during a bank's business hours and pay the excessive fees demanded. Or if you share something on social media that doesn't align with the views of those who run the platform, the platform can delete your account.

So long as people are using their products or services, centralized organizations have the power to be the judge and the jury. This is not to say that all centralized organizations are bad - _in fact, most are good_ - but rather to point out the concerning amount of power these organizations have over their users.

## Characteristics of Blockchains

::: tab Decentralized

### Decentralized

---

Unlike other virtual record-keeping tools, blockchains are not maintained by a single person or an individual organization. Most blockchains are maintained by large networks of participants with no centralized party to take charge or coordinate. Different [blockchain consensus mechanisms](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/types-of-blockchains) are used to ensure that blockchain infrastructure providers are financially incentivized to follow a hard-coded rule and operate in the same (and only) way to keep a blockchain operational and securely decentralized. By aligning the interests between infrastructure providers and users, blockchains are able to maintain decentralization.

The decentralized networks that blockchains run on help ensure that the data being added to the virtual record is accurate and cannot be changed. Data that is added to a blockchain is recorded by the entire network of participants in order to ensure it cannot be quietly manipulated or altered. Most of blockchain technology’s popularity can be attributed to its decentralized nature. Blockchain’s ability to maintain decentralization is what allows it to be trustless, accessible, and transparent while providing self sovereignty for users.

### Trustless

---

Most existing systems require some level of trust between the provider/manufacturer and user/consumer.

> Someone who transfers money through a payment app trusts that payment service will deliver the funds promptly without stealing or freezing them.

> Someone who checks their local weather station trusts that the station is reporting the weather as accurately and timely as possible.

When a blockchain is properly decentralized, no single entity has authority over the record-keeping system. This means that users do not need to trust each other or a third party for the source of truth, or for a system to function as intended. The accuracy of data is verified by network participants who must reach a consensus before it is added to the blockchain.

::: tab Accessible

### Accessible

---

Products and services on the internet aren’t as easily accessible as they may seem. Centralized institutions act as gatekeepers and not everyone is treated equally.

> Banking services are typically only offered to users that meet certain profile requirements in specific jurisdictions.

> Digital content is often censored by governments.

Blockchains allow anyone with an internet connection to access the blockchain-based products and services they need. All users are treated equally, regardless of their identity, location, or financial status. This makes it easier for anyone to gain access to helpful products, services, and content that may otherwise be restricted.

:::

::: tab Transparent

### Transparent

---

Traditional record-keeping systems are rarely transparent. Data is often collected, organized, and presented as fact without actual proof.

> Manufacturers can mislead consumers about the origin of their products.

> Companies can manipulate financial numbers to appear more attractive to investors.

> Researchers can alter data to secure more funding or gain regulatory approval.

Since the data being added to a blockchain is recorded by all of the network’s participants, transparency is required in order for a blockchain to operate. The transparency provided by blockchains can be beneficial to both regulators and companies by providing permanent records of all transactions and simplifying the auditing process. Everyone has the ability to gain access to all transactional data on a blockchain.
