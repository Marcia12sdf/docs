### What are meTokens?

The term "meTokens" stands for Multi-Variant Elastic Tokens, an index product designed to minimize risk by offering a way to bundle and diversify various assets within a single, manageable entity. This strategic approach aims to offer a safer and more efficient option.

<br>

### What is the purpose of meTokens?

The primary objective of meTokens is to minimize individual token’s risk and serve as an alternative to holding those tokens directly. In essence, these tokens function similarly to ETFs and they are constructed using the classic portfolio theory in order to minimize the overall portfolio risk. By bundling various assets, meTokens have less price risk and better capital efficiency.

<br>

### Why do meTokens matter?

1. Diversified Portfolio: meTokens are carefully constructed to reduce risk by bundling assets that have similar pegged value. This diversification spreads asset risk, making your crypto portfolio more resilient in volatile markets.

2. Encouraging Smaller Projects: meTokens encourage the adoption of smaller or emerging stablecoins and tokens, fostering a diverse and thriving ecosystem where all projects can flourish.

3. Extended Use Cases: Thanks to meTokens’s enhanced risk profile, you can use meTokens on UX and get boosted Loan-To-Value than using the individual token as collateral, enjoying more capital efficiency within the Cosmos ecosystem. More use cases will emerge with the adoption of meTokens by more and more platforms.

## meUSD

### What is meUSD?

meUSD, a part of the meTokens family, is a Multi-Variant Elastic Token designed to minimize risk and offer a secure alternative for holding stablecoins. meUSD serves as a bundled package of bluechip and Cosmos-native stablecoins. It's built to disperse the risk associated with the depegging of individual stablecoins, ensuring more consistent performance of a USD pegged stable token.

<br>

### The Composition of meUSD

The meUSD token comprises a mix of stablecoins, each with its own allocation. As of now, the initial stablecoins are: $IST; $USDC; $USDT; $DAI; $USK

These proportions are not set in stone and can be adjusted via governance proposals. This flexibility ensures the stability and adaptability of meUSD over time.

<br>

### How to mint meUSD?

Minting meUSD is a straightforward process. To acquire meUSD, convert any of the stablecoins included in the meUSD index. Umee charges a small, dynamic minting fee, making it an accessible option while having a target minting fee of 0.2%. The dynamic fee structure encourages the use of underrepresented stablecoins to balance the index, ensuring stability and minimizing price risks.

<br>

### What are dynamic fees?

The dynamic fee structure is a critical component of meUSD's design. The fee's value is influenced by the proportion of each stablecoin in the meUSD index. If the allocation of specific tokens deviates from the desired targets, the dynamic fee will increase or decrease. This incentivizes users to choose stablecoins that help maintain the optimal allocation and minimize price risks.

<br>

### Managing risk and arbitrage opportunities

If the composition of the meUSD index becomes unbalanced, the exchange rate may fluctuate. This imbalance creates an arbitrage opportunity for perspicacious users.

For example, if a stablecoin within the meUSD index were to de-peg, users could take advantage of the situation by exchanging their meUSD for the depegged coin, then swapping it for another stablecoin on a platform like Osmosis, and finally re-supplying it back into meUSD. This process can increase the original amount of meUSD owned and offers an opportunity for profit.
