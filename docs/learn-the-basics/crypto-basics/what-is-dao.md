## The Principal-Agent Problem

Let’s say Jon’s car is making a strange noise while starting up, so he takes it to the local garage to get it checked out, where the mechanic immediately identifies the issue as something small.

Unbeknownst to Jon, the mechanic earns a commission on all repairs and sales at the shop. Rather than performing the easy fix and sending Jon on his way, the mechanic tells Jon that his car has some serious damage that will require several new parts to be installed so that he earns a greater commission. Jon isn't an expert, so he takes the mechanic's word and agrees to pay for the "necessary" repairs.

This is an example of a principal-agent problem, where the incentives of two parties involved in some business transaction aren’t properly aligned. In this scenario, Jon is the principal, and he’s incentivized to get his car fixed as quickly and cheaply as possible. The mechanic is the agent, and he’s incentivized to get Jon to spend as much money at his shop as possible - regardless of Jon’s specific needs.

## What is a DAO?

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is a new type of organizational model commonly used by crypto projects to help solve the principal-agent problem by aligning incentives and distributing decision making power to all [stakeholders](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-dao.html#stakeholders).

DAOs often issue [governance tokens](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/types-of-crypto.html#governance-tokens) in order to enable the [decentralized governance](/governance) of the organization. Usually a specific amount of governance tokens must be deposited in order to [submit a governance proposal](/users/governance/creating-proposal), and all governance token holders are able to [vote on the proposal](/users/governance/voting) (1 token typically equals 1 vote). Governance tokens are usually distributed between all stakeholders in an attempt to properly balance the decision making powers and to help align their interests by incentivizing them all to bring more value to the protocol.

## Stakeholders

:::: tabs

::: tab Users

### Users

---

Similarly to how a networking platform no one adopts is obsolete, or a software no one uses has no value, a [blockchain]() or application that no one interacts with is problematic. Users are the most important ingredient for every blockchain and product because they are ultimately the customers who need to be served. A network effect occurs as more users interact with a blockchain and the applications built on top of it, and both the blockchain and applications become more valuable for all users.

::: tab Contributors

### Contributors

---

Contributors play a key role in the birth and growth of a network since users generally gravitate towards the best products that serve their needs. For example, developers are needed to launch a new blockchain, create the actual products that users demand, and fine tune them to provide a superior experience in order to attract more users. Educators are needed to help assist and onboard new users. [Liquidity providers](/learn-the-basics/defi-basics/what-is-liquidity-mining) are needed in order for a [DeFi](/learn-the-basics/defi-basics/) project to serve its users. There are countless ways to contribute, and DAOs often attract and retain talented contributors by giving them a say in the direction of a project.

::: tab Infrastructure Providers

### Infrastructure Providers

---

Since infrastructure providers (like [validators](/learn-the-basics/staking-basics/what-is-validator)) are responsible for actually running and securing a network, it’s incredibly important that they remain properly aligned with other stakeholders. Validators need to operate their nodes properly and perform upgrades as requested by stakeholders in order for a blockchain to function as intended. Running a validator node usually requires time, skill, and operational costs, so it’s important for validators to have a place at the table.

## Off-Chain vs On-Chain

:::: tabs

::: tab Off-Chain

### Off-Chain Governance

---

Off-chain governance simply means that a DAO’s governance decisions cannot be automatically enforced on a blockchain. When a DAO uses off-chain governance the votes are used to signal sentiment, but there is no guarantee that the results of the vote will be respected. Off-chain governance is best used for non-technical proposals that cannot be executed on-chain anyways, or for DAOs with fewer members and niche purposes that need to make smaller decisions frequently.

:::

::: tab On-Chain

### On-Chain Governance

---

On-chain governance means that a DAO’s governance decisions can be automatically enforced through self-executing code once a proposal has been passed. It’s important for highly decentralized DAOs to use on-chain governance in order to guarantee that the DAO’s decisions are respected no matter what. On-chain governance is useful for making controversial decisions that may impact stakeholders differently, like changes to a protocol that may significantly affect those who run it, build on it, or use it.
