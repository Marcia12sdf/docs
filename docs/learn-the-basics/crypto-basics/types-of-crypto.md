# Types of Crypto

## Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are the most well-known type of crypto-asset, and can be broadly defined as digital units that originate on [blockchain](/learn-the-basics/blockchain-basics/what-is-blockchain). 

> Examples include BTC, ETH, and [UX](/overview/UX-token).

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a form of crypto-asset that are intended to allow users to enjoy the benefits of [crypto](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-crypto) and [web3](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-web3) without having to deal with the volatility commonly associated with other cryptos. Stablecoins achieve their price stability by being pegged to or backed by a commodity or fiat currency, or by using algorithmic economics to regulate supply and demand. Many popular stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, meaning that in theory they can always be redeemed by a user for $1 or $1 worth of another asset. There are several different types of stablecoins that can be classified based on their stability mechanisms.

::: tab Fiat-Backed

### Fiat-Backed Stablecoins

****

> Examples include USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD, and GUSD.

Fiat-backed stablecoins aim to hold their pegs by maintaining reserves in fiat currencies. These stablecoins are commonly pegged to the US dollar due to its strength relative to other currencies.

##### Advantages

Fiat-backed stablecoins are a popular choice among DeFi users because they have faith that they can redeem one fiat-backed stablecoin for one physical unit of the currency it represents at any time.

##### Disadvantages

Centralized entities are needed to issue fiat-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves. This means that a fiat-backed stablecoin is only as good as the organization that issues it. These organizations may be targeted by authorities who wish to maintain full control over a currency, and/or be subject to banking regulations which other stablecoins may not be.

### Crypto-Backed Stablecoins

****

> Examples include DAI and MIM.

Crypto-backed stablecoins are exactly what they sound like; stablecoins backed by other cryptocurrencies. Crypto-backed stablecoins typically require users to deposit crypto assets of greater value, and require users to be over-collateralized in order to maintain a $1 peg.

##### Advantages

Crypto-backed stablecoins offer levels of decentralization that fiat-backed stablecoins cannot.

##### Disadvantages

Crypto-backed stablecoins are only as good as the underlying collateral that backs them and the protocol that issues them. If a protocol is unable to ensure that crypto-backed stablecoins are properly over-collateralized at all times, the crypto-backed stablecoins issued by the protocol may lose their peg. High levels of over-collateralization are typically needed in order for crypto-backed stablecoins to be issued in order to protect the peg during times of extreme market volatility.

::: tab Commodity-Backed

### Commodity-Backed Stablecoins

****

> Examples include PAXG and XAUT.

Commodity-backed stablecoins are similar to fiat-backed stablecoins, except they are pegged to a commodity rather than a fiat currency, and thus issuers maintain reserves of commodities. Since commodities fluctuate in value, commodity-backed stablecoins also fluctuate.

##### Advantages

Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to gain exposure to key commodities while offering the same fungibility as other cryptos. Commodity-backed stablecoins allow users to transact with commodities in ways that are not possible through legacy markets.

##### Disadvantages

Just like with fiat-backed stablecoins, centralized entities are typically needed to issue commodity-backed stablecoins and manage the reserves in order to ensure that one stablecoin can be redeemed for one unit of the commodity.

:::

::: tab Algorithmic

### Algorithmic Stablecoins

****

> Examples include FEI, UST, and AMPL.

Algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed by other crypto-assets. They use algorithms to maintain their peg, which often involve the minting and burning of tokens based on the demand and value of the circulating stablecoin driven by economic incentives determined by their on-chain algorithms.

##### Advantages

Algorithmic stablecoins are decentralized and may not require significant levels of over-collateralization to be issued.

##### Disadvantages

Since algorithmic stablecoins are unbacked or partially backed, they are more susceptible to a de-peg than other types of stablecoins during market turmoil.

## Utility Tokens

In the real world people often purchase or receive gift cards which can be used to pay for various products or services offered by the organization that issued them. While a giftcard is considered a cash equivalent, a gift card issued by one organization cannot be used to pay for a product or service offered by another organization; therefore a giftcard only has value if the product or service it can be redeemed for is considered valuable. 

In crypto, people must purchase or earn utility tokens to be able to access a specific product or service within a [web3](/learn-the-basics/crypto-basics/what-is-web3) application or blockchain ecosystem. The value of utility tokens generally fluctuate in relation to the perceived value of the products or services they can be redeemed for. This allows a free market to determine the fair price associated with different products and services. Unlike gift cards which are limited by various terms and conditions, utility tokens are fungible and can be freely lent, borrowed, or traded thanks to the accessibility and trustless nature of blockchains. 

> Examples include LINK, BAT, and [UX](/overview/UX-token).

## Governance Tokens

In traditional organizations all decision making power often lies in the hands of a small group of individuals known as the board of directors. While investors, employees, and customers are all stakeholders, they generally have minimal say in the decision making processes.

In crypto, governance tokens are often issued to users, contributors, and investors of a specific project in order to help distribute the decision making power and align the interests of all stakeholders. Governance tokens grant holders the ability to [vote on issues](/users/governance/voting) related to the specific application or network they represent - usually one token equals one vote, and a specific amount of governance tokens are required in order for an individual to [submit a governance proposal](/users/governance/creating-proposal) to be voted on by other token holders. 

> Examples include YFI, SNX, and [UX](/overview/UX-token).
